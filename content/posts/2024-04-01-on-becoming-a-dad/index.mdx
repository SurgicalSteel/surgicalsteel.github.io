Finally, the big day for me and my wife has come. On February 24th this year, our first daughter was born. I remember the moment she was born, I had a mixed feeling and emotion as I was able to watch my wife delivering her through C-Section surgery.  

Proud, happy, fear, sad (yes, I had a lot of 'what if' question in my head the night before, mostly questioning ourself, are we ready to become mom and dad?), and emotional all mixed into one and I cannot hold my tears while trying to ease my wife. On my first look at my newborn daughter, she's so cute and looks more like me with her chubby cheeks and her thick black hair.  

On the beginning after our daughter was born, we were accompanied by my mother in law and my father in law to learn how to handle our newborn daughter like : how to ease her, how to breastfeed properly, how to change diaper, how to prepare and bathe her, etc. I know that my role here as a husband is very important to my wife that I have to help everything that I can do, cheer her, support her, comfort her all to help stabilize her emotions and to prevent [baby blues](https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/pregnancy-parenting/parenting-babies-0-12-months/new-parents/baby-blues).  

Once my mother in law and my father in law came back to their home, we felt sad a little bit because we were only two clueless new parent with a baby. But it didn't take long time to realize that we must do this together and that we can do it. That's the spirit that we carry until today and beyond.  

Priorities do change, and our hours of sleep have been reduced. But thankfully, all of my teammates at work understand my struggle (some of them are already have kids, so... yes, they do really understand). Even when my fully-concentrated coding hour has changed, I still manage to do my work and find times to code outside working hours to finish my tasks.  

One month and seven days later, after learning by doing how to handle a newborn baby everyday, we finally get used to it. A lot of helpful tips from our families and friends who visited us really helped us, also big thanks to my friend Citra (who is also a new mom) for a lot of useful tips. I remember one quote by Nelson Mandela, "It always seems impossible until it's done". Well, not a really job done, but we used to do it correctly.  

One big reflections that I feel when I take care of my daughter is that, in my thought, 'when I was at this stage, my parents also did the same to me, took me carefully and tirelessly responds to my cry as a baby'. It it changed me into a person who respects my parents even more. I love you mom, I love you dad.  

My wife is still on recovery phase from the C-section, and my daughter is in healthy condition. And as I finished writing this blog post, I have done easing my daughter and prepared for her milk.  

See you later!
